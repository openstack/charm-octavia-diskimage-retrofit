# layer-basic requires setuptools<42, zipp>=2.0.0 requires setuptools>42
# LP: #1862186
zipp < 2.0.0
# Pin setuptools as tactical fix for LP: 1855766. Can be removed when

# layer basic brings in flit core but this charm does not need it
# and it causes issues. So add tactical fix to stop it being installed by
# adding condition that will not be fulfilled on Bionic or Focal
