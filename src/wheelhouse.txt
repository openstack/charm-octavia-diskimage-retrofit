# python-zipp 2.x introduces a requirement for setuptools 42.x which is not available.
# resolve conflict:
# layer-basic requires setuptools<42, zipp>=2.0.0 requires setuptools>42
# LP: #1862186
zipp < 2.0.0
# Pin setuptools as tactical fix for LP: 1855766. Can be removed when
# https://github.com/juju-solutions/layer-basic/issues/149 is fixed
